                    <br>I am interested in IT because of its functionality and benefit to improve human life quality.
                    When I was young, I was always confused about how the computer data worked. The data which woke my
                    curiosity was gaming data. I remembered I used to love to play warcraft back then, and at that time
                    custom map that made by warcraft’s customers or the fan of were amazing. All I need to do was
                    downloading and waiting for a moment. When the downloaded content finished and I opened the
                    downloaded file, it was only a simple text file which contained numerous words and numbers. What
                    special about them was I could not understand any of them, I thought it was not english, but
                    surprisingly it was code (programming language of the computer). At that moment there was variety of
                    questions in my head and I wondered why just those code could transform into a big map of the game,
                    and it was even more interesting as the code also computed specific details of the map. It was a big
                    curiosity for me back then. At the current age, I still wonder why I am not at that level to
                    understand all the code inside that small file.
                    <br>
                    <br>There are different things that I have to learn in IT, but only writing code make me feel
                    excited the most. Coding is a fundamental work in IT as all the IT majors require coding. So far
                    coding is not easy, because it like math plus foreigner language. It is logical, but also, we need
                    to learn by heart a lot. This compound is a big challenge for new students which want to get in It.
                    When a novice learner knows how to code, he will has a feeling of accomplishment which can motivate
                    him or her to learn and understand more. The moment I can code easy things like normal math, turtle
                    picture and other things, I’m not an expert in IT but I have to consider that coding is the basic
                    thing in IT but the problem here is each app in PC may contain different programming language and
                    structure for specific circumstances.
                    <br>
                    <br>When I enrolled into IT, I first applied into Business of Management but then I switched to IT
                    later. I understood that if I switched my major, I would have to restart my learning process, but I
                    have no regret for it as RMIT creates a high-quality education. This university have a modern
                    learning style compared to other universities in Vietnam. The programs are delivered through
                    lectures, tutorials, projects, group work and industry placement. The special thing about them is
                    professional recognition. The Bachelor of Information Technology program is accredited at the
                    professional level by the Australian Computer Society (ACS). The ACS is a signatory to the Seoul
                    Accord, an agreement responsible for accreditation or recognition of tertiary-level computing and IT
                    related qualifications worldwide. This shows commitment to good practice in computing and IT-related
                    education.
                    <br>
                    <br>The system of RMIT enr ollment is highly organized and because all students need to reach 6.5 in
                    IELTS test in order to start an academic program. The other option is participating in the English
                    course which is provided by RMIT and its learning progress can improve the student’s English skill
                    to the same as the 6.5 IELTs ones. Through that method, the university can ensure that the students
                    are able to adapt the English learning environment in every major. English learning experience is
                    necessary because every international or Vietnamese company needs English as the primary or
                    secondary language to communicate.

                    salary.
                    <br> We are living in a modern world so every individual or organization need to have their own
                    website in
                    order to introduce about themselves. But this job also require some technical skills such as :

                    <br>I can choose your focus on front- end, back-end full of stack


                    <br>1. Technical skills:
                    <br>+ Good Diploma / Degree in Computer Science / Information Technologies.
                    <br>+ Java EE developer experience (Java Core, Java EE , SPRING).

                    -My personal profile is a mediator:

                    + Mediator is a personality which is very creativity in work. Because these type of people can link
                    numerous
                    things into a big picture, so we can have a better example for our work. Normally mediator can be
                    creativity
                    and visualize enough to develop a big image for their project. Therefore most of them are poets and
                    actors.

                    + As my perspective. I do not know I’m a mediator or not but the test is quiet true about my
                    personality,
                    but just one different thing about me. I can be creativity, I can link many things and make it
                    visualize for
                    other people to see about the picture in my head. But I do not like to write or act so there is no
                    chance I
                    can be an actor or a poet.
                    We share the same personality that we do not like to have power, because with us power sometimes
                    just make
                    us feel tired and it is meaningless to us.

                    + We honor what is right or wrong, but I’m might be different. I also curious about math and
                    logical, so
                    that is why I choose IT as my major. I believe that math and logical can lead me to make a right
                    decision.
                    In mathematic everything make sense when it come to a right formula or a right function.
                    I do not choose business like most of people in RMIT because I do not know what to answer or to do
                    when it
                    come to a complicated situation, I just want to know what is right or wrong and try to fix it.
                    Like every others mediator, when people or my friends sad about something and they need me. Then of
                    course I
                    will try to make them feel better in emotionally, but after than I also try to help them to solve
                    there
                    problem because afraid that if the next time I would not be there for them, then who will help and
                    take care
                    of them.
                    So yes I’m sometimes can be more very motional like every mediator, but I also try to fix the
                    problem after
                    that. I believe that the best way to help other people is help them to fix the problem either in the
                    emotional part and the situation part

                    My personal profile in learning style-test :
                    <br> - I’m a auditory/visual learner. I understand things by seeing and listening to it . Basically
                    when I
                    try to figure out about a typical thing I will try to find the image about it, it would be better if
                    I can
                    have a clear visual in real in life.
                    The next step I will try research about that thing by asking other people about it in order to hear
                    its bio
                    and contain all the information that I already heard and saw. After combine all the information
                    together for
                    me to have a clear definition and to know how it is functioned.
                    Especially I can transfer it into my own words, and explain it to people who are sinking information
                    about
                    that object just like me in the past.
                    <br>- People who are auditory/visual learner like me can learn and remember things extremely fast,
                    but also
                    may forget as fast as we learn. The reason is we need to create a picture about that typical object
                    inside
                    our head and the sound of that thing, so if we have to learn a pile big pile of words or formula, or
                    can be
                    even pictures.
                    We often forget the earliest things that we already remembered.
                    We also have another weakness, we are not good at learning just by reading doing paper work to
                    understand.
                    In other words if there are nothing to hear, or see then it would be a real challenge for us.

                        Overview :
                        <br>-This game name’s is Build and Shoot .This project is a mini game which is created on unity engine. This is a game on mini games web pages, so everybody can play online just for fun or if they like the game too much they can download it on the webpage to their desktop in order to enjoy the game. The project have a simple game play. Players can control his or her character, this character can use bricks to create the path that force or allow zombies to move as his way. I’m using unity to create this game, because it is easy to export and require only c-sharp. The special about unity is its adaptation to different computer’s configuration, so the stronger configuration is the better performance that unity can delivery to the users.
                        <br>
                        <br>.Motivation :
                        <br>Motivation : 
                        -My game is attractive because of its simplicity. The gameplay is easy for the players to understand the game flow, so people can feel they are focusing on the game mission. Because the game is created on Unity, therefore it has an flexible option in selecting an appropriate configuration that is suitable for the computer’s specification. It also does not require complicated skills to create the project, only c-sharp programming and basic logical algorithm are necessary, so the final product is high quality.  
                        <br>
                        <br>Description :
                        <br>
                        <br>-High speed: Build  and shoot is a highspeed action game. The speed factor can boost the energy of the players, therefore they will have an extremely excited experience when they interact with the character in the game. I also add in heavy metal music to make the players be more aggressive , and react faster against the enemy attacks.
                         This factor is special effect to make them feel like they are warriors who having a battle  bad force. The impact of pushing the mentality of the players is a first step to attract them, so they are willing to take more challenges and move to the next level. Eventually they are going to push themselves to the limit in order to reach to the highest level.

                         <br>-Creativity :This project is not only has a rushing gameplay, it also provide a shopping place for the players after they defeat a level. The shop have different types of weapon and brick, each one of them have unique effect in order to make players to create their own playstyle. For example shotgun is a short range weapon, so it will be a good combination with big brick because big brick has a small quantity but has a high duration. 
                        Duration in build and shoot is factor that measure how well the brick can hold against bullet and zombie attacks, therefore it can last long for the shotgun to wipe out all zombie at that level. 
                        <br>
                        <br>-High risk high reward:  My mini-game has a melee weapon that can deal a big amount of damage in the range of 70 degree in front of them character. If the zombies are destroyed by melee weapon it would drop more money and more capacity of supplement such as heath, armor , pieces of brick.
                         But the downside can put the players into dangerous situation, because melee weapons require the character to put him/herself into a range that both zombies and players can attack. At that extremely close  range numerous zombies will attack simultaneously, so the result maybe a major injure or can be an instant death.
                         <br>
                         <br>-Highly competitive: Even though build and shoot is a mini-game but it has a scoreboard for the players to show the others their achievement. But they  are only allowed to save their score on the specific scoreboard, it means there are 3 of them which are easy medium and hard. 
                         So players can only save base on the mod that they selected. This maybe make players feel sad sometimes, but it keep them to try and improve more. Especially users can see the score in other mods to encourage them to try their best.. There are only 30 levels but the ways to increase the score are variable such as using melee weapons, shoot into the head of the zombie, pass a level without taking any damage. 
                         These tips may enhance the skills of each player, so may join the higher position in the competition.

                        -Interesting story line: Most of mini-games do not have a story because developer try to make it as simple as possible. But in my opinion a game without a story is incomplete, users will not able to understand what is happening. There are players do not care about the story because with them action is matter, how about the others. 
                        That is why build and shoot have a conversation of the character about each the place he or she is going to fight, so the curiosity of players will make the game more interesting. I also make a skip button for who refer only action instead of reading a story line to satisfy their requirements.
                        <br>
                        <br> Tools and Technologies:Tools and Technologies: The software that I’m using is unity, this software allow me to feel not to worry about payment and my hardware. Unity optimize with my PC, it means unity can recognize what hardware that I am using and recommend the best performance that I can put into my project, it is super convenience .
                        I also use Github as a relevant software to do teamwork with my teammates, Github is a software that help people can post their files and ideas into 1 master brand, then the other members can post their to smaller branches, so the old files will not be wipe out. 
                        <br>Skills required: I have to know how to use C-sharp as the main skill in order to use unity, I also need understand how Github community work in order to utilize all the functions of this software. 
                        In the early state it take me a lot of time to learn C-sharp, similar to all kind of coding language, it has some special word that only itself has. The unique of each coding language is the biggest hurdle for me, but later I found that it is easy when  I get use to unity just like when I learned python
                        <br>Outcome: The result of build and shoot Is heavily important to me, this project is a first step for me create bigger projects in the future. The effort that I have spent will transfer into the outcome. I looking forward about the success of this project in order to have a good background for me to be an employee for gaming companies in the future. Even it fail I still learn a lot from my mistake. I want to do the best and spend all my time in this project so whenever it become successful or not I still can learn something, so I can create better projects.
